## **INTRODUCTION**
---
### Project Overview
**krediq**  - An one step  web-based invoice discounting platform  designed to simplify and optimize the process of invoice discounting for your businesses . With the aim of providing seamless financial solutions, krediq streamlines the complex process of invoice discounting, empowering SME's to unlock their working capital growth.

### Technologies Used
The following technologies and tools were used in the development of krediq :

- Django (version 4.2.5)
- Python (version 3.12.1)
- Django Rest Framework (version 3.2.5)
- Pandas (version 2.0.2)
- Django Channels (version 4.0.0)


### Architecture Plan
- The Application is build based on greenfield deployment model and further gets utilizes with blue-green model for forward stages .
- Design patterns are effectively utilized in-order to meet enterprise software experience .
- The project is well refactored with pep guidelines  and architectured with the following criteria:

      - **W**ebsocket **B**ased **A**rchitecture (WBA)
      - **M**essage **O**riented **M**iddleware (MOA)
      - **E**vent **D**riven **A**rchitecture (EDA)
      - **R**epresentational **S**tate **T**ransfer (REST)

### Transition Design overview 
- Consider an program contract with action of **SUBMIT** , the program starts with an lifcycle of initial sign moves to sign A , B and C so far .
- when the user configured the required number of signs in their admin panel , the algorithm automatically sets the last sign and applies further execution of code .
- The last sign values are captured using **observer design pattern** in simple django signals . 


???+ Warning

    - The signals works only for administrator and supervisor user . 




``` mermaid
graph LR
  a1((initial sign)) ---> A(((sign A))) ---> B(((sign B))) ---> C(((sign C)))
```

### Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)

- [DB Diagram](https://dbdiagram.io/d/63bef4286afaa541e5d1da72) 

### Database Schema
```
   class Name(models.Model):
      first_name = models.charfield(max_length = 100)
      last_name = models.charfield(max_length = 200)
```


### Indexing techniques
```
   indexes = [
         models.Index(fields=["name"]),
         models.Index(fields=["account_number"]),
         models.Index(fields=["customer_id"]),
      ]
```

### Request/Response Examples
```
{
    "status": "Success",
    "data": []
}
```

##  **AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION**
---
### User Management
- A user is linked to a party , in-detail a party can have multiple users of different type .
- User logs-in to the system via a 6 digit OTP sent to the user's email and phone number .

### Access Control
- An **administrator** user who can login and can do all transactional process with endless permissions (cannot login to admin panel).
- An **supervisor** user who can login and can do transactional process with permission accessed by his party administrator (cannot login to admin panel).
- An **master admin** user who is allowed to perform all actions without restrictions except the signal trigger (can login to admin panel). 

### Token-based Authentication
- After OTP verification , the user gets logged-in to the system and a  64 bit Token will be shared to the user for authentication and authorization purposes . 

## **DATA PROCESSING AND CALCULATION**
---
### Dashboard data
- Data's for krediq customer's account dashboard are prepared in folder **/service/socket/query/**
- Processed data shared along with APF or RF seller's and along bank's .
- Data's are shared to customer's panel via websockets for real time accesibility .

### Calculation Methods and Formulas

- **Finance percentage**
      - (finance_amount / invoice_amount )*100

- **Finance amount**
      - (**min**(max_invoice_amount, Invoice Amount) * max_invoice_percent) / 100 

- **Utilization percent**
      -  (used_limit / max_limit_amount) * 100

## **PERFORMANCE OPTIMIZATION**
---
### Caching Strategies
- using django cache to store large and frequently used data
- added redis and memcache for better cache management .

### Database Query Optimization
- usage of methods like **select_related** and **prefetch_related**
- Updated reverse relation queries inorder to make smaller queries 

### Asynchronous Tasks

- celery tasks to manage background tasks
- you can run the celery with below command 

            celery -A krediq worker --pool=solo -B -l info 

- for celery task scheduling use the below command

            celery -A krediq beat -l info

- for celery beat db detachment
            
            celery -A krediq beat --detach -l info

## **SECURITY AND PRIVACY**
---
### Data Encryption
- Using django's signer for to encrypt and decrypt customer's financial information .
- Ensuring that all sensitive data, both in transit and at rest, is encrypted using industry-standard algorithms. 
- Using HTTPS for communication and encrypt sensitive fields in the database.
- Added TLS and SLS for better security .

### Secure coding practices
- Validating data that goes and comes back to the application 
- Avoid hardcoding sensitive information such as API keys or passwords directly in the code. 
- Use any Vault or KMS for credential management .
